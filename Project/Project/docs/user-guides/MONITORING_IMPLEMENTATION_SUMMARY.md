# Monitoring, Metrics, and Performance Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 15 has been successfully implemented, adding comprehensive monitoring, metrics collection, and performance optimization features to the Student Evaluator System. This implementation addresses the NFR-01 and NFR-02 requirements for performance and monitoring.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Spring Boot Actuator Integration

**Enhanced Configuration:**
- Extended actuator endpoints exposure to include: health, info, metrics, prometheus, httptrace, loggers, threaddump, heapdump
- Configured detailed health checks with component visibility
- Added Prometheus metrics export support
- Enabled percentile histograms for HTTP request metrics
- Added application-specific tags for better metric organization

**Configuration Location:** `src/main/resources/application.yml`

### 2. Database Connection Pooling Optimization

**HikariCP Enhancements:**
- Optimized pool sizing with configurable parameters
- Added leak detection with 60-second threshold
- Enabled JMX monitoring with `register-mbeans: true`
- Configured connection validation and initialization timeouts
- Added environment-specific configuration support

**Key Settings:**
- Maximum pool size: 20 (configurable via `DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE`)
- Minimum idle connections: 5
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Leak detection threshold: 60 seconds

### 3. Caching Strategy Implementation

**Technologies Used:**
- Spring Boot Cache with Caffeine as the cache provider
- Micrometer for cache metrics collection

**Cache Configuration:**
- Maximum cache size: 1000 entries
- Expiration: 30 minutes after write
- Statistics recording enabled for monitoring

**Cached Operations:**
- Assignment retrieval by ID (`@Cacheable`)
- All assignments list (`@Cacheable`)
- Student evaluation history (`@Cacheable`)
- Student evaluation statistics (`@Cacheable`)
- Automatic cache eviction on data updates (`@CacheEvict`)

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/main/java/com/studentevaluator/config/CacheConfig.java`
- Enhanced `EvaluationService.java` and `AssignmentService.java` with caching annotations

### 4. Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**Custom Performance Monitor:**
- Real-time tracking of evaluation processing times
- Compilation time monitoring
- Test execution time tracking
- Success/failure rate calculations
- Configurable performance thresholds with automatic alerting

**Metrics Collected:**
- Evaluation duration (with percentiles)
- Compilation duration
- Test execution duration
- Success/failure counters
- Performance threshold violations

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- Evaluation warning: 30 seconds
- Evaluation critical: 60 seconds
- Compilation warning: 10 seconds
- Test execution warning: 20 seconds

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/main/java/com/studentevaluator/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.java`
- `src/main/java/com/studentevaluator/controller/MonitoringController.java`

### 5. Custom Health Indicators

**System Health Monitoring:**
- Temporary directory accessibility checks
- Java compiler availability verification
- System resource monitoring (memory, processors)
- Detailed health status reporting

**Implementation File:**
- `src/main/java/com/studentevaluator/monitoring/EvaluationSystemHealthIndicator.java`

### 6. Performance Testing Suite

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- Single evaluation performance validation (30-second limit)
- Concurrent evaluation performance testing
- API response time validation (5-second limit)
- Memory usage stability testing
- Load testing with sustained request patterns
- Cache performance validation

**Test Categories:**
- **Performance Tests:** Validate system meets response time requirements
- **Load Tests:** Test system behavior under concurrent load
- **Cache Performance Tests:** Verify caching improves performance

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/test/java/com/studentevaluator/performance/PerformanceTest.java`
- `src/test/java/com/studentevaluator/performance/LoadTest.java`
- `src/test/java/com/studentevaluator/performance/CachePerformanceTest.java`
- `src/test/java/com/studentevaluator/monitoring/PerformanceMonitorTest.java`
